# Dialysis Healthcare Dashboard: Global Health Patterns Visualized:

This Project is based on Dialysis Healthcare Analysis where we had two CSV files namely Dialysis-I and Dialysis-II.

We had over 7K+ records in each files.

Worked on key metrics like patient statistics, treatments, facilities and organizational performances like Total Performance Score and Chain Organizations.

Uncovered insights into readmission rates, profitability and regional facility distribution enhancing decision making for healthcare management.

For some KPI's, in Tableau, we had to convert discrete columns into continuous columns and vice-verse to get the desired output.

We even created some calculated fields for KPI like category texts "as expected" in which we filtered the data accordingly.

Changed the data type as and when needed.

At last, designed a robust interactive dashboard in Tableau. It will filter data accordingly when clicked on one particular visual of KPI's.

Conducted a thorough cleaning and cleansing operation in Excel and then imported the datasets into MYSQL where we had to create a new database namely "healthcare" to analyze and get exact numbers by using Aggregate functions, Joins and so on.

For Power BI, we created a one to one relationship for Dialysis I and Dialysis II, as both columns contained some unique values. With the help of DAX functions we were able to derive quick solutions for calculations. Lastly, we inserted 3 Slicer like county, state and profitability so that we'll be able to see the visualizations accordingly as and when needed.
